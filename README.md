# Pizzeria

Project Title:
Pizzeria Database

Project Description:
Designed a relational database for a client who opened a new pizzeria (takeouts and deliveries only). This database will allow thr client to store all the important data and information that the business generates.
We also run some custom queries which help gauge the business performance. Our main focus is on Orders and Stock/Inventory.

Tools Used:
QuickDBD - Helps design the schema without writing the scripts.
MySQL Workbench - Writing custom queries
Microsoft Excel - Storing the customer, stock, orders data.

Challenges faced:
1. Once we create a sample schema, we notice a lot of redundancies. To fix this issue we did "Normalizing".
2. Ran into issues while loading data from CSV files to the Workbench. To fix this issue, we made sure all the data types were correct for all the fields in the tables and made sure the data type "Dat" was in correct format "YYYY-MM-DD".
